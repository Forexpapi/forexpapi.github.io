The Term "Christian" and Our Identity in Christ

The word “Christian” is widely recognized today as the label for those who follow the teachings of Jesus Christ. However, it is important to understand the origin of this term and what it truly signifies. As we look deeper into the Bible, we realize that the Apostle Paul, in his missionary journeys, is credited with popularizing the term to describe believers in Christ. However, this term was not coined by Jesus Himself. Instead, it was used to identify the early followers of Christ, particularly in relation to the pagan world. Today, God calls His people something even more profound: He calls us kings.

The Origin of "Christian"

The Bible records that the term “Christian” was first used in the city of Antioch. In Acts 11:26, we read:

> “And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.”



It is important to note that this term was not initially a title given by Jesus to His followers. Rather, it was used by outsiders, especially the pagans, to label the followers of Jesus, recognizing them as a distinct group from the rest of the religious sects. The word “Christian” was likely derived from the Greek word Christianos, meaning "belonging to Christ." This term was used by the pagans to describe these new followers who professed faith in Jesus Christ. It was a label, rather than a title of honor, and it marked the followers of Christ as distinct from the other religious people of that time.

The Pagans and the Name "Christians"

During the time of the early Church, the people who were known for their religious devotion—whether Jewish, Greek, or Roman—were often viewed as the religious leaders and were categorized by their respective beliefs. To the pagans, those who followed Jesus Christ were simply another group of religious people. They had their own customs, rituals, and belief systems, but they were seen as just another faction in a world full of diverse religious practices.

It was Paul’s teachings and missionary work that helped spread the message of Jesus to the Gentiles, breaking down the barriers between Jews and non-Jews. Paul’s influence likely contributed to the adoption of the term "Christian," as the pagans saw this movement as something new and different from traditional Jewish faith. In Acts 26:28, when Paul was speaking before King Agrippa, he was questioned about his faith:

> "Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian."



Thus, Paul is not the originator of the term, but he was instrumental in spreading it and making it known to the Gentiles.

Our True Identity in Christ: Kings

While “Christian” has become a widely accepted term to describe believers in Christ, it is important to understand that the Bible teaches us much more about our identity in Christ. Jesus never referred to His followers as “Christians.” Instead, He spoke of us as sons and daughters of God, co-heirs with Christ, and even kings.

In Revelation 1:6, we are told:

> “And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.”



This passage reveals that God has elevated believers to a position of royalty. We are not simply religious people; we are kings and priests with authority, representing the Kingdom of God on earth. Jesus Christ, through His sacrifice, has made us heirs to His Kingdom, giving us the power to reign in life through Him (Romans 5:17).

This understanding shifts the way we view ourselves as believers. While the term “Christian” may label us in a general sense, it is crucial to recognize that our identity goes far beyond that. We are children of the King, made to rule and reign in this life as representatives of God’s Kingdom.

Conclusion

The term “Christian” may have originated as a label used by pagans to identify the followers of Jesus, but the Bible reveals a far greater truth about our identity. As believers, we are not just religious people—we are kings and priests, called to reign with Christ. Let us remember that Jesus never referred to us as "Christians"; instead, He called us sons and daughters of the Most High God, heirs to His Kingdom. As we walk in this truth, let us embrace the authority and power that comes with our true identity in Christ, knowing that we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us (Romans 8:37).
